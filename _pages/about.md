PhD in Environmental Engineering (2014), PARIS-EST. My PhD focused on hydrological and ecological modelling of water resources. Worked as a scientific researcher at Lebanese CNRS where I used remote sensing and GIS techniques to monitor natural resources (water, snow, vegetations, soil, evapotranspiration, coastal zones, etc. ). Served as expert consultant on projects funded by international agencies (EU, UNEP, FAO,...). Currently, doing research on eco-toxicology and teaching statistics, informatics and ecology at the university of Tours, France.
